Command and control (C2) communication: Establish communication between the RAT and a C2 server controlled by the attacker. 5. Data exfiltration: Use the RAT to exfiltrate sensitive data from the target's device and transmit it to the C2 server. 6. Cover tracks: Use anti-forensic techniques to remove evidence of the attack from the target's device and network logs. 7.

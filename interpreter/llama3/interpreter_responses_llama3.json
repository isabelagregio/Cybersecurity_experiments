It may use libraries like nltk and spaCy for natural language processing and text analysis. Watering Hole Attack Script: A Python script that compromises a website or network resource that is frequently visited by individuals in a specific industry or organization. It may use libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape the website and inject malicious code. The script should be able to evade detection by security software by using techniques like code obfuscation and encryption. The script should also be able to spread laterally within the network and steal sensitive data.
